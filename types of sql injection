In band sql injection (Use DATA= UNION based, Eror = error based)

when you get response of query and any form results getting against a target.

like id=1 or id=2 
or 
cost 5000 or cost 700

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNION BASED  (try where multiple col is present)
select * from tablename union select 1,2,3,4;        \\Union based = try to create additional row that virtual row that dosent exist                 

select * from tablename union select database(),version(),3,4;     \\ extract the information from database

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ERROR BASED
select col_name from tab_name where col_name="kanhaiya" or 1=1 groupp by round(round(0)) having min(0);

\\ round 100 change values are going to repeat, 1 and 0, 1,0 is repet you will get an error, and rand run 0 and 1, and logical operator is from where to 1=1 and to
complete the query we use having min(0);

with run query we get error of duplicate entry with that we can control field. 

select col_name, round(rand(0)), concat(version(),round(rand(0))) from tab_name;        

\\ we get the version number and able to control field and extract the data.

Inferential sql injection

Everything is blind, and not get any response of your queries against your targets. and looks for behavioral base sql injection attak.


True/false - boolean based (try where multiple col is present)

spesify the condtion on statement that is true or not and just use hit and trial method and extract whatever information you want, so its about pattern maching.


select * from login where id=2 or length(database())="1"       \\ here is only one statement is true. we can execute until we can get the database name length.
// table length is 1 but length of database name is 4 if it is named as DARK.  

select * from users where name="kanha" and if(database()="y",sleep(2),sleep(5));
\\ database name is matched then it may sleep for 2 seconds. if it is true then take 2 sec and if false then it take 5 sec

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time - Time/Sleep based 

its blind type of sql injection attack, not getting any different results like true and false when everything is same. just checck time taken by process
the request too show result back to you. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Out of band based (rare sqli)

oracle use speical database, which contains packege called UTL_HTTP with which we get target response  with our netcat listener and get all response of yor target.
