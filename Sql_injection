Defination: 

common attack vector usage maliciouse sql code to manipulate backend database. manipulation of the information which is not intented to be displayed,
(username,passoword, database credentials, sensitive information, anything information relete to database)


How it works: 

Must find an input parameter within the web application that included inside an SQL Query.

vulnerable website needs to directly include user input within an SQL statements. an attacker can then insert a payload that will be included as part of the SQL Query and 
run against the database server. 

\ 
'
" -- 
" order by 10 -- 
' or sleep (10)


SQLi based on union based, error based, double query based, blind boolean based, blind time based 


INJECTION POINT FOR SQL INJECTION 

-> GET BASED (URL PERAMETER like : any.com/filename.programming?perameter.value)  
-> POST BASED (FIND HTML FORM LIKE : SIGNUP, PASSWORD RESET, LOGIN )
-> HEADER BASED (REFERRER, USER-AGENT, LOCATION, HOST)
-> COOKIE BASED (find cookie perameter like : cookie: username=dbsajd)


SQLI QUERY FIXING 

1- identfy sqli vulnerability. ('   "     / )
2- balance the query.
3- Run the query to fix ( like select id ='1'    --+ where )   // --+ will exclude/remove the other thing from query


Get based 

")   then query for fixing is ") --+

Post based

\'  then query for fixing in form ' --_     \\ ' -- space used to fix the query.
